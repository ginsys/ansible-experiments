## Default variables
The default shells depending on the OS are:

- Linux: `/bin/bash`
- FreeBSD: `/bin/cshrc`

This is defined in the `defaults` section of the **users** role


## Example inventory
```
user_groups:
  - name: mygroup
    gid: 700


users:
  - name: remember
    state: present
    password: "blabla"
    groups:
      - mygroup
    uid: 1100
    keys:
      - file: key1
        state: present
    bash_lines:
      - line: "export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$HOME/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh"
        state: present
      - line: "alias ls='ls lah'"
        state: present
  - name: test
    keys:
      - file: key2
        state: absent
    csh_lines:
      - line: "ls ls -lah"
        state: absent
```
## Using the Role
### Example Playbook
```
---
- name: Manage user configuration
  hosts: all
  remote_user: root
  roles:
    - users
```
### Configure a user's ssh keys
For every user a directory matching the username should be created under the _keys_ folder in the role's _files_ folder. In this folder the user's ssh keys can be stored.

```
├── files
│   └── keys
│       ├── remember
│       │   └── key1.pub
│       └── test
│           └── key2.pub
```
The name of the file holding the key should match the name in the _users_ variable

```
    keys:
      - file: key1
        state: present
```

### Configure a user's shell
This role allows you to add or remove lines to a user's `.bashrc` or `cshrc` file. Since this is not based on a template that overwrites the complete file, users can still add their own configuration too.

Add items to the **shell_lines** key in the **users** variable. Each item exists of a _line_ and _state_ key.

Example:
```
shell_lines:
  - line: "testline"
    state: absent
  - line: "export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$HOME/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh"
    state: present
  - line: "alias ls='ls lah'"
    state: present
```
